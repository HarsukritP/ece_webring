# ECE Webring

### What is this?
This is a webring for current/prior **Electrical and Computer Engineering** students at the **University of Waterloo**. Webrings are a relic of the '90s, linking together related websites in order to increase traffic. This was SEO back in the day. No bots, no AI, just _people_, forming an online community. This website is clearly inspired by the [SE Webring](https://se-webring.xyz/), and the old ECE webring that is now inactive.

### How to join:
If you'd like to add your website, you must be either a current [UW ECE](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computer-engineering) student, alumni, or a professor in the faculty. We have a standard pipeline for PR's:
1. Pick an image you'd like to use. Take a look at our website; We use your image and "ASCII-ify" it for style points. Run your image through [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/), which will spit out a PNG of your image without a background.
2. Add your image to `public\people`. Rename this image to `[yourfirstname].png`, ensuring it is in lowercase.
3. Add your information to `src\pages\api\members.js`.
4. Open a [pull request](src\pages\api\members.js) on this repository with your changes.
 
Then, we will review your PR. If you've followed the above instructions, you'll show up on the website! üßôüèª

### Community
While we aren't following the "real" webring tradition of each site on the ring having links to the _previous_ and _next_ sites, we do want to have people visit this site and find others. Accordingly, we ask that everyone who makes a PR also add a backlink to [ece.engineering](https://ece.engineering/). You could do this with either the ECE logo or plaintext.
